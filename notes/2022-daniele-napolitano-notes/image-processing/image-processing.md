_aims at improving the quality of images. It's very useful to apply before a Computer Vision algorithm, as a Preprocessing step (simplifies analysis)._<br>

For all data analysis applications it's valid the say "_Garbage in, garbage out_", which applies also to computer vision.<br>
Image processing allows to get the most out of the input data.<br>
In Deep Learning computer visiones, this process can also include data augmentation<br>
<br>
This operation includes:<br>
- functioning of the Pinhole Camera model<br>
- techniques to deal with Image Noise through Image Filters<br>
- Perform Edge Detection<br>
